NanoChat
=====

NanoChat is a peer to peer chat application that can be used inside command line. My final goal is to create a lightweight tool for making mesh networks among connected nodes for transfering text and media in a fast and secure way. The nodes can create **one-to-one** or **one-to-many** networks.
Also NanoChat is using [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org) socket library that provides several common communication patterns.
